# CIS233DA-Course-Resources
Repo contains the resources for activities to be used in CIS233DA v8 at Rio Salado College.

## Site Deployment
This repo uses GitHub Pages to publish the website. The published site utilizes the `gh-pages` branch to pull the information from. Any edits should be done on the `main` branch or on a new branch that is merged to the `main` branch. Once edits are ready to be made live, a pull request should be created to merge the changes into the `gh-pages` branch.
